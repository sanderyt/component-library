# My own component library to learn unit testing and setup for React projects

After building some front-ends, I noticed that I am using the same components a lot. That's why I am now building my own React component library, which I will be publish on NPM later. My other goals I want to learn, is to develop projects faster, by automate some standard tasks.

What I have implemented so far now:

- [ ] Create a command, so you generate automatically a React component with stylesheet and test
- [ ] Add a ESlint to the project, so the code will be consisted trough the project itself
- [ ] Create a starter package with React, Typescript, SCSSS and all these implementations

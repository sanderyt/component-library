# Component library by Sander van Rijsoort

After building some front-ends, I noticed that I am using the same components a lot. That's why I am now building my own React component library, which I will be publish on NPM later. My other goals I want to learn, is to develop projects faster, by automate some standard tasks. Also I will be learning about writing unit tests in React.

What I have implemented so far now:

- [x] Create a command, so you generate automatically a React component with stylesheet and test
- [ ] Add a ESlint to the project, so the code will be consisted trough the project itself
- [ ] Create a starter package with React, Typescript, SCSSS and all these implementations

## About the library

Creating a component by command

```
yarn component ComponentName
```
